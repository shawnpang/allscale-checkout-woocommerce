# Allscale Checkout for WooCommerce

A WordPress/WooCommerce payment gateway plugin that lets merchants accept crypto payments via [Allscale Checkout](https://allscale.io). Customers pay in fiat-denominated amounts, and funds settle instantly as **USDT stablecoin** directly to the merchant's wallet.

## Why Allscale?

- **Non-custodial** — Funds go straight to your wallet. No platform holds your money.
- **Low fees** — 0.5% per transaction (vs ~3-5% on traditional processors).
- **Instant settlement** — On-chain USDT, no waiting days for payouts.
- **No account freezes** — Your funds are on-chain and always accessible.
- **Permissionless setup** — Self-custodial, so you can start accepting payments right away.
- **163 fiat currencies supported** — USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, and many more.

## How It Works

1. Customer places an order on your WooCommerce store and selects "Pay with Allscale".
2. The plugin creates a checkout intent via the Allscale API.
3. Customer is redirected to a hosted Allscale checkout page to complete payment using their Allscale account or a crypto wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.).
4. Payment confirms on-chain and Allscale notifies your store via webhook.
5. The WooCommerce order is automatically marked as paid.

## Features

- **WooCommerce payment gateway** — Shows up as a payment option at checkout.
- **Automatic order management** — Orders update in real time based on payment status.
- **Webhook verification** — Cryptographically verifies all incoming webhook notifications (HMAC-SHA256).
- **Status polling fallback** — Polls the Allscale API for payment status in case a webhook is missed.
- **Sandbox mode** — Test the full flow without real transactions.
- **Configurable currency** — Choose which fiat currency to denominate prices in.
- **Secure by design** — API secrets stored encrypted in WordPress, all signing done server-side, timing-safe signature comparison.
